# How to view parts of the object for fine editing
## Option 1. (View / Clipping Pane)
**[ View/Clipping Pane ]**, edit and adjust this temporary view according to your needs. All changes will be lost when the dialog is closed

## Option 2. (View / Persistent Section Cut)
**[ View/Persistent Section Cut ]**, same as above but changes will be saved once done. A new object will be created too, to roll back just delete newly created object and parts
