- OpenSCAD Measurement tool  
    https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:280469  
    OpenSCAD is a good design tool but it totally misses measurement functions because
    it wasn't created for that.  
    I'm aware of it but sometimes it is useful to make few inspections on the working project
    without relying on external tools like Blender. 
    This is just a dirty hack but seems to do that job well.
